# Issues

 While the bot has been constantly receving updates from me since October 2022, with me fixing bugs and adding new features, there will inevitably still be unwanted bugs in the program that I have not noticed.
 
 If you run into bugs while using this bot, please raise an issue so that I can fix it, or if you can fix it for me, you can be a contributor to the project.
